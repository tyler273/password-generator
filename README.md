# PASSWORD GENERATOR

## Description

The goal of this project was create an application that would generate randomized passwords according to the user's selected criteria of wanting either uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers or special characters. The app will prompt the user to select between 8-128 characters and it will notify them if they do not meet the criteria. Selecting OK or Cancel will determine Yes/No for criteria until a password is generated in the designated field.
